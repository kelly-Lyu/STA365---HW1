This repository contains answers to three questions related to Bayesian statistics and probability distributions:

Q1: Proportion of Students Who Pass the Class

Calculate the probability of passing the class based on the likelihood of answering a question quickly.

Q2: Bayesian Inference with Multinomial and Dirichlet Distributions

Apply Bayes' Theorem to derive the posterior distribution using a multinomial likelihood and a Dirichlet prior.

Q3: Multinomial Sampling and Dirichlet Posterior Visualization

Generate a sample from a multinomial distribution and visualize the Dirichlet prior and posterior using ternary plots.
